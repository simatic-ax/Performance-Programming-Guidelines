# Performance Programming Guidelines

This repository serves to provide programming guidelines for users of SIMATIC AX.
It's primary goal is to address programming related suggestions that impact the runtime performance.

## Target platforms

Generally, the assumed target platform is the SIMATIC S7-1500 / S7-1500T portfolio. This includes also the S7-1508S (Software Controller) and S7-1504D / S7-1507D (Drive Controllers).

Furthermore, suggestions for other potential targets of SIMATIC AX (e. g. SINUMERIK) can be included and need to be documented accordingly.

## Adding guideline topics

The [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) explains how to create an issue in relation to the SIMATIC AX programming guidelines.
Feedback or requirements regarding SIMATIC AX are out of scope of the programming guidelines.

The programming guidelines are not meant as as substitute for the official documentation and learnings and therefore do not explain basic technial aspects.
